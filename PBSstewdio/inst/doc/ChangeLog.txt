===================================
Authors:  JTS = Jon T. Schnute
          RH  = Rowan Haigh
-----------------------------------

0.1.0 (2024-05-24) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * GUI
    + Changed the choice of package builds from check widgets to radio widgets (RH 240524)
    + Created new GUI called `green' that controls processes to be evaluated and executed (RH 240524)
  * R code
    + Added new function `runExpr' to run expressions through a GUI named `green' (RH 240524)
      - Needed to transfer R code from the function body to the GUI's <Start> button

0.0.9 (2024-05-18) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * GUI
    + Separated the directory paths from R package to a new first notebook tab `Directory Paths' (RH 240514)
  * R code
    + Modified function `.win.paths' to allow user to select different pathways through pop-up GUI (RH 240514)
      - previously, pathways could only be altered by directly editing the entry boxes
      - changes in pop-up GUI still update the main-GUI pathways (now in notebook tab 1)
      - debugged code to generate WDF `pathWin' to load/save pathways from/to `Rpaths.txt'.
    + Changed function names to reflect actions identified by JTS (RH 240515)
      - `.win.edit' changed to `.win.collect'
      - `.win.edit.file' changed to `.win.edit'
      - `.win.run.file' changed to `.win.convert' and `.win.source'
    + Added new function `.win.make.pkg' to create a new package skeleton (RH 240518)
      - R function `package.skeleton' not used because it tries to be too smart

0.0.8 (2024-05-10) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * GUI
    + Fixed the edit GUI to display file names that contain spaces (RH 240910)
  * R code
    + Edited function `.win.edit' deal with missing stw files or stw files in arbitarary locations (RH 240510)
    + Added function `.win.run.file' to run certain file types from the edit menu (RH 240510)

0.0.7 (2024-05-09) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * GUI
    + Re-arranged the GUI buttons, added debug check box, and added etry box to select *.stw file (RH 240509)
      - *.stw file is a simple way to open specific files using patterns instead of displaying the whole shebang
  * R code
    + Edited function `.win.edit' to use full pathway names to files, and to use stw files (RH 240509)
      - v.0.0.6 did not contain the most recent `edit.win' code for date 240508 due to an oversight

0.0.6 (2024-05-08) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * GUI
    + Try to ensure that `dirRepo' and `dirBuild' do not include `package' in the directory specification (RH 240508)
      - i.e., both directories should point to a level above the package directory
    + Changed number of columns in edit GUI to be dynamic, not fixed a three columns (RH 240508)
      - Still need to think about issue of many (>30) files occurring for any particular extension
    + Disabled error checking in `.loadGUI()' and `.updateGUI()' because it's handled in `.win.check()' (RH 240508)

0.0.5 (2024-05-07) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * GUI
    + loads existing `Rpaths.txt' file on start up, otherwise paths are left blank (RH 240502)
    + Created a new GUI for collecting files and editing those selected (RH 240507)

0.0.4 (2024-05-01) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * GUI
    + Added dot helper functions `.flush.cat' and `.win.build' to build packages (RH 240501)


0.0.3 (2024-04-30) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Package
    + Cleared the path to test R CMD check and it crashed because pdflatex.exe could not be found. (RH 240430)
      - Added the MiKTeX directory:
      -    set path=.;C:\Apps\MiKTeX\miktex\bin\x64
      - and the check on PBSadmb:
      -    C:\Apps\R\Rdev64\bin\x64\R CMD check PBSadmb_1.1.7.tar.gz
      - worked like a charm. Then tried it on PBSmapping, which contains C source code, and it was also  successful.
      - Guessing that the latest R installations come with their own compilers:
      -    * used C compiler: 'gcc.exe (GCC) 13.2.0'
      -    * used C++ compiler: 'G__~1.EXE (GCC) 13.2.0'
      - because gcc.exe was not on the path.
    + Specify only two paths in the GUI: R installation and the MiKTeX installation (RH 240430)
  * GUI
    + Added dot helper functions `.updateGUI', `.win.paths', `.win.check' to manipulate operations via GUIs (RH 240430)

0.0.2 (2024-04-29) [Rcheck=F, Rbuild=F]
  * Documentation
    + Added `README.md' to root directory `pbs-stewdio', primarily for GitHub (RH 240426)
  * Package
    + Determined how to install devtools from their GitHub site (RH 240426)
      - install.packages("pak")    ## has a dependency solver, so it finds version conflicts before performing the installation
      - pak::pak("r-lib/devtools") ## finally managed to install devtools on R.4.5.0 (R-devel, 2024-04-22 r86468 ucrt) 
    + Abandoned devtools to explore batch files (RH 240429)

0.0.1 (2024-04-25) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Creation
    + From the mind of JTS, a new package is born
      - RH likes the connotation of poking a stick into Hadley Wickham's eye (Rstudio)
