-----------------------------------

0.0.2 (2024-04-29) [Rcheck=F, Rbuild=F]
  * Documentation
    + Added `README.md' to root directory `pbs-stewdio', primarily for GitHub (RH 240426)
  * Package
    + Determined how to install devtools from their GitHub site (RH 240426)
      - install.packages("pak")    ## has a dependency solver, so it finds version conflicts before performing the installation
      - pak::pak("r-lib/devtools") ## finally managed to install devtools on R.4.5.0 (R-devel, 2024-04-22 r86468 ucrt) 
    + Abandoned devtools to explore batch files (RH 240429)

0.0.1 (2024-04-25) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Creation
    + From the mind of JTS, a new package is born
      - RH likes the connotation of poking a stick into Hadley Wickham's eye (Rstudio)
