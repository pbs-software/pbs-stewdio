===================================
Authors:  JTS = Jon T. Schnute
          RH  = Rowan Haigh
-----------------------------------

0.0.6 (2024-05-08) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * GUI
    + Try to ensure that `dirRepo' and `dirBuild' do not include `package' in the directory specification (RH 240508)
      - i.e., both directories should point to a level above the package directory
    + Changed number of columns in edit GUI to be dynamic, not fixed a three columns (RH 240508)
      - Still need to think about issue of many (>30) files occurring for any particular extension
    + Disabled error checking in `.loadGUI()' and `.updateGUI()' because it's handled in `.win.check()' (RH 240508)

0.0.5 (2024-05-07) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * GUI
    + loads existing `Rpaths.txt' file on start up, otherwise paths are left blank (RH 240502)
    + Created a new GUI for collecting files and editing those selected (RH 240507)

0.0.4 (2024-05-01) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * GUI
    + Added dot helper functions `.flush.cat' and `.win.build' to build packages (RH 240501)


0.0.3 (2024-04-30) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Package
    + Cleared the path to test R CMD check and it crashed because pdflatex.exe could not be found. (RH 240430)
      - Added the MiKTeX directory:
      -    set path=.;C:\Apps\MiKTeX\miktex\bin\x64
      - and the check on PBSadmb:
      -    C:\Apps\R\Rdev64\bin\x64\R CMD check PBSadmb_1.1.7.tar.gz
      - worked like a charm. Then tried it on PBSmapping, which contains C source code, and it was also  successful.
      - Guessing that the latest R installations come with their own compilers:
      -    * used C compiler: 'gcc.exe (GCC) 13.2.0'
      -    * used C++ compiler: 'G__~1.EXE (GCC) 13.2.0'
      - because gcc.exe was not on the path.
    + Specify only two paths in the GUI: R installation and the MiKTeX installation (RH 240430)
  * GUI
    + Added dot helper functions `.updateGUI', `.win.paths', `.win.check' to manipulate operations via GUIs (RH 240430)

0.0.2 (2024-04-29) [Rcheck=F, Rbuild=F]
  * Documentation
    + Added `README.md' to root directory `pbs-stewdio', primarily for GitHub (RH 240426)
  * Package
    + Determined how to install devtools from their GitHub site (RH 240426)
      - install.packages("pak")    ## has a dependency solver, so it finds version conflicts before performing the installation
      - pak::pak("r-lib/devtools") ## finally managed to install devtools on R.4.5.0 (R-devel, 2024-04-22 r86468 ucrt) 
    + Abandoned devtools to explore batch files (RH 240429)

0.0.1 (2024-04-25) [Rcheck=T, Rbuild=T]
  * Creation
    + From the mind of JTS, a new package is born
      - RH likes the connotation of poking a stick into Hadley Wickham's eye (Rstudio)
