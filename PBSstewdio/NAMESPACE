# Packages declared in the 'Depends' field should not also be in the 'Imports' field (from R-exts.pdf).
# For PBSadmb I have to IMPORT and DEPEND on PBSmodelling.
import( methods, PBSmodelling ) ##, devtools ) ## devtools way too buggy and cumbersome

#importFrom("graphics", "axis", "lines", "mtext", "pairs", "par", "points")
#importFrom("utils", "read.table", "write.table")

# Import the S4 options manager from PBSmodelling (doesn't work)
#importClassesFrom(PBSmodelling, PBSoptions)
#importMethodsFrom(PBSmodelling, initialize, print, show)

# Export all non-dot names from PBSadmb
exportPattern("^[^\\.]")

## need .PBSadmbEnv
#export(.PBSadmbEnv)

# R now requires documentation for all exported objects,
#  even dot functions; not desirable to keep them in the NAMESPACE.
#export(.version)
exportPattern("^\\.update")  ## needed by GUI functions
exportPattern("^\\.win\\.")  ## needed by GUI functions
