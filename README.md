## PBSstewdio: A Code Kitchen ##
&copy; Fisheries and Oceans Canada (2024)

The R package **PBSstewdio** provides a GUI interface for checking and building R packages. The GUI interface is built using **PBSmodelling**, and consequently flexible by design. The GUI, named `PBSstew`, can be invoked with the R command `stew()`.

**PBSstewdio** arose from the mind of Dr. Jon T. Schnute (Scientist Emeritus, Nanaimo BC) who desired an easier way to check and build packages given hand-mobility issues. This aligns with the Government of Canada's goal of <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/government/publicservice/wellness-inclusion-diversity-public-service/diversity-inclusion-public-service/accessibility-public-service.html">accessibility in the public service</a>.

**PBSstewdio** represents just one of a series of R packages developed at the Pacific Biological Station (<a href="http://www.pac.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/science/facilities-installations/index-eng.html#pbs">PBS</a>) in Nanaimo, British Columbia. The package is available on GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/pbs-software">PBS Software</a> project. The repository for **PBSstewdio** in PBS Software is available at <a href="https://github.com/pbs-software/pbs-stewdio">pbs-stewdio</a>.

In theory, one can install `PBSstewdio` using **devtools** using `devtools::install_github("pbs-software/pbs-stewdio/PBSstewdio")`. Installing **devtools** itself is another matter. On their GiHub site, they suggest:<br>
`install.packages("pak")`<br>
`pak::pak("r-lib/devtools")`

As with any freely available product, there is no warranty or promise that **PBSstewdio** will perform adequately for all circumstances. Additionally, coding errors are possible, and users should contact the package maintainer if bugs are detected.
